I have included some diferent programs with diferent logics as a code optimization procedure (like Delay routines using normal, timer without interrupt, with interrupts etc) which will work with the same circuit as well. I usually upload only codes and circuit which are tested over softwares and hardwares. So you can just download and use it for your purpose.
